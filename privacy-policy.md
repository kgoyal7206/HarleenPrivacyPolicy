Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues

Improve the App’s performance and reliability

Important: The App provides educational information only. It does not provide medical advice. Any insulin values logged are entered by the user.

4. AI Processing & Third-Party Services

To provide meal analysis features, we use third-party services that may process your information:

Supabase: Used for authentication and to store your account data, meal history, and uploaded meal photos.

These providers process data according to their own privacy and security practices.

5. Data Storage, Security, and International Transfers

Your data is stored using Supabase (cloud infrastructure). Data may be processed and stored in countries other than your own, depending on where our service providers operate. We use reasonable safeguards such as encrypted transmission (HTTPS) and access controls, but no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.

6. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal information. We share data only:

With the service providers listed above to operate the App

If required by law or to protect rights/safety

With your consent

7. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide the service. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable period, except where retention is required for legal or security purposes.
